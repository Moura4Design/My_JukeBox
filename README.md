# My_JukeBox
Project Overview:
This project was built during my studies at New York Code + Academy. It is an assignment where I was tasked with creating a Jukebox music player.
The project features a simple web-based jukebox/music player that allows users to control playback with the following actions:
. Play
. Pause
. Stop
. Preview
. Next
. Previous

The system is composed of two primary components:
musicList - This represents the collection of songs available in the jukebox.
Jukebox - This is the main class that handles the music player functionality, including controls and navigation between songs.

HTML:
The HTML file forms the structure of the Jukebox Music Player web application. It provides the user interface (UI) where users can interact with the player. Users can select songs and control playback. The layout includes control buttons like play, pause, stop, next, and previous.

CSS:
The CSS code provides styling for the Jukebox Music Playerâ€™s UI. It features a modern and minimalistic design, with visually appealing elements:
. Control buttons
. Layout:
. Text styling
. Progress bar
